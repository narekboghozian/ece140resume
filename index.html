            <br> <br><br> We've been at sea for almost 2 weeks now. The rental boat is holding up well, and so has the drone. Ryan's been taking some awesome pictures with it.
            Really proud of the kids for braving through school alone the past couple weeks.
            We could have brought them along but It's been too long since we've had alome time like this. <br><br><br> Anyway that's about to end because we're going down to Australia to meet up with some old friends next. They'll join us up to Japan where we'll drop off the boat and part ways.
